## 🤖 What is this?

A seemingly harmless game of Rock-Paper-Scissors...  
But what if I told you it’s more than just a game?

This project is a **Python-based terminal version** of Rock-Paper-Scissors — built with simple logic, ASCII art, and just enough randomness to make you doubt if the machine *really is* playing fair...

> Can you beat the algorithm... or is the algorithm playing *you*?

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and intuitive CLI interface  
- Random AI opponent powered by Python's `random` module  
- Visual feedback with ASCII art (because why not?)  
- Input validation for fair gameplay  
- Suspiciously balanced win/loss ratio... 👀
